Data was collected from 30 volunteers wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) with sensor signals while performing six activities: 
walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying. 
The tidy data set (Course_Project.txt) represents the average value for each subject-activity combination.

For each subject-activity combination, data is recorded by sensor signals: accelerometer and gyroscrope. 
The accelerometer is also filtered by gravitational and body motion components. Both time and frequency were collected for each feature. 

Variables for each subject/activity are classified as:
1st) time vs frequency (“time” or “freq”)
2nd) accounting for body movement or gravity (“Body” or “Gravity”)
3rd) collected by either the accelerometer or the gyroscope (“Acc” or “Gyro”)
4th)* body acceleration and velocity given in Jerk signals or the magnitude (“Jerk” or “Mag”)
5th) the mean or standard deviation for each variable (“Mean” or “Stdev”) 
last)* the axis of movement (“X”, “Y”, or “Z”)


* denotes that this classification is only listed in the variable name when applicable
